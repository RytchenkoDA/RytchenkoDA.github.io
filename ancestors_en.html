                            <p>V.I. Talanin is a descendant of the ancient Russian aristocratic family. At present, a continuous direct male ascending line of kinship in 32 generations has been studied in detail. In addition, many side branches from the main genus have been investigated.</p>
                            <p>In VI-X centuries (until 945/946) the ancestors were the ruling pre-varangian dynasty of the Russian state (the Niskinich dynasty, the so-called “Drevlian principality” of the Russian chronicles or the “State of Dir” by Arab authors). In 945/946 the last Grand Prince (G.P.) Niszkina was overthrown by the Varangian Rurik dynasty. From marriage the G.P. Svyatoslav I [969-972] with Princess Mala was born Vladimir I Saint [980-1015], whose descendants are all subsequent Rurikids. From the elder brother of Princess Mala – Dobrynia (Dobroslav) Niskinich – the male branch of the clan went: the descendants of the older brother (Dobrynia) always have a genealogical seniority to the descendants of the younger sister (Mala).</p>
                            <p>Until the 1130s, Niskinichi were hereditary posadniki in Veliky Novgorod. Then, as a result of the victory of the opposition, they lost their hereditary power becoming one of the main Novgorod boyars clans (the Nerevsky district). In X-XII centuries women from the Niskinich clan married to European monarchs. The granddaughter of Dobrynia Niskinich became the mother of the Hungarian kings Andrew I [1046-1060] and Bela I [1060-1063], i.e., all subsequent members of the Arpad dynasty. The descendant of Dobrynya Nyskinich in the fifth knee, Euphrosyne Mstislavna (daughter of G.P. Mstislav I [1125-1132]), became the wife of the Hungarian king Geza II [1141-1162]. Her daughters were married to the Czech Přemyslid dynasty, Babenberg, Petralif-Komnin, and Wittelsbach families, which taking into account the cross marriages of the Arpads, means bonds with virtually all sovereign dynasties of Europe. In particular, the great-granddaughter of Euphrosyne - Yolande, the queen (1235) of Aragon - became the mother of Isabella, the queen (1270) of France. The her granddaughter was Isabella, the queen (1308) of England, the mother of the English king Edward III [1327-1377] (this king became the ancestor of all subsequent British monarchs up to the present). At the beginning of the XIII century the descendants of the Novgorodian Niskinich's along the male line are migrated in the Hungarian kingdom, and they founded the noble family Orrus (Oros, Orozi). The descendants of this genus became in the XIV-XV centuries the German genus von Naso and Polish genus Nasuta (whose descendants are currently living in Poland and Belarus). Also a descendant of this genus became the Hungarian genus Tisza de Borosjenő.</p>
                            <p>In pre-Mongol period of Russian history the Niskinich's actively patronized the processes of Russian chronicling and the creation of medieval literature in the form of Russian epics, which were examples of classical skaldic poetry. The famous Novgorod-Seversky tysyatsky Raguil Dobrynich, who became the author of "The Tale of Igor's Campaign", was a direct descendant of Dobrynya Niskinych in the fifth generation and uncle of Euphrosyne Mstislavna. In addition, in XII-XIII centuries the Novgorod Niskinich's professionally engaged in military affairs, leading military units which became the prototype of the later army special forces. In 1320 they founded the famous Novgorod ushkuiniks movement. In particular, during the first campaigns of ushkuiniks their first ruler boyarin Luka Varfolomeyevich (d. 1342/1343) colonized and assigned Dvina land to the Novgorod principality.</p>
                            <p>In the first half of the XIII century the Novgorod Niskinich's in the person of Nerevsky boyars of Malyshevich family actively supported the Vladimir-Suzdal Rurikids, retaining Veliky Novgorod in a common all-Russian field and becoming the local pillar of G.P. Alexander Nevsky in his struggle with Western Europe. A member of this family was canonized in 1461 as St. Barlaam of Khutyn (in XV-XVI centuries he was the spiritual patron of Moscow Rurikids). And also belonged to the general genus such hierarchs as prominent at one time as: 1) Dobrynya Yadreykovich (Barlaam of Khutyn second-cousin nephew), Anthony as a monk, and the second abbot of the Novgorod Khutyn monastery [1208/1209 – 1210] (the founder and the first abbot of this monastery was Barlaam of Khutyn [1180s – 1208/1209]); he is also the Archbishop of Novgorod [1210-1218, 1226-1228, 1228-1229] and the Bishop of Przemysl [1219-1225]; 2) St. Xenophon of Robeika (uncle of Barlaam of Khutyn canonized in XIV century), third abbot of Khutyn monastery [1210-1230], founder and first abbot of Xenophontos Robeika monastery [1230-1262].</p>
                            <p>The southern branch of Niskinich's (Galician branch) pursued a policy similar to that of the Novgorod branch. Galician Niskinich's in 1205-1245 actively fought with Daniil Romanovich, Prince of Volyn. Galician Niskinich's were headed, according to annals, by the famous family of Kormilchich's. However, in 1240s their struggle ended in defeat, due to which South Russia was captured and divided between Lithuania and Poland.</p>
                            <p>After the cessation of the inner Novgorod wars for higher power the Novgorod Niskinich's in the person of the Nerev boyar families of Mishinichi and Ontsiforovichi from 1272 to 1471 regularly occupied the post of Novgorod posadnik. Simultaneously, from 1270 to 1478, the family of the Mishiniches, then Grigorievichs (since 1300s), and then the Ontsiforovichs (since 1351/1352) were hereditary governors of Korel land in Novgorod principality. In 1384 the boyar Yuri Ontsiforovich became the founder city of Yam (later Yamburg, modern Kingisepp).</p>
                            <p>After reunification of Novgorod with Moscow (1478) the Korel governor was deprived of his post but remained under the Moscow governor as Karelian ruler until 1499/1500. Members of Ontsiforovich family in 1478 were left in Veliky Novgorod in the status of boyars, while the family of Mishinich's was repressed through executions and exile, and the family of Grigorievich's was repressed by transferring it from the category of boyars to black peasantry. The descendants of the boyars Grigorievich's are living up to this day in the Arkhangelsk region (Dvina land) as families of Amosovs, Lent'evs, Kologrivovs, Onezhsky Klyucharyovs.</p>
                            <p>In 1499/1500 all the previously not repressed old-Novgorod boyars were deprived of boyar status but were ranked among the all-Russian noble category. In 1540s this category was reformed: the governance took their lands which they owned along patrimonial right but then returned it along landed right. As reform result many descendants of the old-Novgorod nobility for one reason or another were not included in the official Russian nobility. Thus, the direct descendants of the last Korel's governor in the third knee became large Novgorod merchants (usurers, silk merchants and expensive clothes), and also in the 1570s repeatedly held the position of a tselovalnik (a member of city government elected by voting from merchants and craftsmans).</p>
                            <p>In 1579/1580 all descendants of Ontsiforovich family moved to Nizhny Novgorod where merchant Lukyan Leontievich became the founder of village Bogorodskoye (modern city of Bogorodsk, Nizhny Novgorod region) and his elder brother, the monk Porfiry, founded and became the first abbot of the Nizhny Novgorod Descent of the Holy Spirit monastery [1579/1580 - 1600/1604]. The descendants of the eldest son of the merchant Lukyan began to live in Nizhny Novgorod ordinary citizens. The grandson of the merchant Lukyan (from the second son of Lukyan) Kuzma Minin became a Russian national hero, the Savior of Fatherland. Members of his clan branch moved to Moscow and having founded the noble genuses of Minin and Voinov. The descendants of the three younger sons of the merchant Lukyan remained to live in the Bogorodsky village in the status of peasants as well as white priests at the church of Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and founding the local families of the Tretyakov, Popov, Talanin, Proskuryakov/Proskurnikov, Ponomarevs. The Talanin family was hereditary priests at this church until 1711–1715 when the break-up of traditional Russian society from Tsar Peter I [1682-1725] forced them to become landowner peasants. A descendant of the last priest Afanasy Vasilievich (d. after 1722) in 10th generation is a V.I. Talanin.</p>
                            <p>Since 1720s the Bogorodsk Talanins were listed in the intra-estate category of “commercial peasants” and by 1820 owned the tannery. Since 1860s the Bogorodsk Talanins became merchants of 2nd guild. The direct great-grandfather of V.I. Talanin in the male line in 1917 for awarding the Order of St. George restored the hereditary nobility.
